ItemRendering
=============

Test classes for Item Rendering in Minecraft.
See http://greyminecraftcoder.blogspot.com.au/2013/09/sample-code-for-rendering-items.html

Some notes:
If you intend to use this code you'll need to copy the contents of the textures folder into your assets location.  

This is constructed as

{base path}/assets/{mod name}/textures/items/{Icon name}.png

In my case, during development this was (eg)

C:\Documents and Settings\TheGreyGhost\My Documents\IDEAprojects\ForgeCurrent\out\production\testitemrendering\assets\testitemrendering\textures\items/error.png
